`eponge` is a small package, which facilitates selective object removal. 
It was released on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eponge/index.html) at 23th March 2020. Initially, the package was named `sponge`, but during first submission trial I found out, that currently there exists the [SPONGE](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SPONGE.html) package, availbale on BioConductor. Because of that, I decided to rename my package, changing only one letter. The package was given a new name: `eponge`, which simply means *sponge* in [French](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A9ponge). Let me present, what the package was created for.

## Removing objects by name
Typically, when we want to remove all objects from the **global environment**, we can use click the broom icon in RStudio (supposing we use this IDE - but in most cases, we do).
Alternatively, we can obtain the same results combining `rm` with `ls`.

```{r rm.example}
# Remove all the objects
rm(list = ls())
# Remove object with 'iris' in its name
rm(list = ls(pattern = "iris"))
```

`eponge` offers a an equivalent shortcut: `erase` function. It's particularly handy when we want to select some set of objects using regex pattern.

```{r eponge.erase.all}
# Remove all the objects
eponge::erase() 
# Remove object with 'iris' in its name
eponge::erase("iris")
```
