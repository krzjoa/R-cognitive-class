## Why do we may need double dispatch?

In most cases, when writing R scripts or even creating R packages, it is enough to use standard functions or S3 methods. However, there is one important field that forces us to consider **double dispatch** question:
**arithemetic operators**.

Suppose we'd like to create a class, which fits the problem we're currently working on.
Let's name such class **beer**.

```{r new.class}
beer <- function(type){
  structure(list(type  = type),class = "beer")
}

opener <- function(){
  structure(list(), class = "opener")
}

pilsner <- beer("pilnser")
my_opener <- opener()
```

Then, we create an operator which defines some non-standard behaviour.

* if we add an opener to the beer, we get an **opened_beer**.
* adding a **numeric** _x_, we get a case of beers (which even contain a negative number of bees, i.e. our owe...)
* if second argument is different than a or **opener** or **numeric**, we get... untouched beer


Let's demonstrate, how does it work:


```{r beer.opener}
`+.beer` <- function(a, b){
  if (inherits(b, "opener")) {
        return(structure(list(
          name  = paste("opened", a$name)
    ), class = "opened_beer"))
  } else if (inherits(b, "numeric")) {
    print("It's magic! You've got a case of beers!")
    return(structure(list(
        n_beers = 1 + b
    ), class = "case_of_beers"))
  } else {
    return(a)
  }
}
```

```{r addition.1}
pilsner + my_opener
```

```{r addition.2}
pilsner + -0.1
```

Don't you think, that such operations should be **commutative**? 

```{r addition.reversed.1}
my_opener + pilsner
```

What did happen here? This is an example of the way the R interpreter handles arithmetic operator. It was described with details on [**Hiroaki Yutani's blog**](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/double-dispatch-of-s3-method/). Briefly speaking, in this particular case R engine matched method to the second argument (not to the first one), because there is no `+.opener` S3 method. What about such trick:

```{r commutative.addition}
`+.opener` <- function(a, b) b + a
```

After that, the result is different:

```{r addition.commutative.1, error=TRUE}
my_opener + pilsner
```
We crashed our function call. When both objects have the `+` method defined and these methods are not the same, R is trying to resolve the conflict by applying an internal `+`. It obviously cannot work. This case could be easily solved using more 'ifs' in the `+.beer` beer function body. But let's face a different situation.
```{r addition.commutative.2, error=TRUE}
-0.1 + pilsner
```

What a mess! Simple S3 methods are definitely not the best solution when we need the double dispatch.

## S4 class: a classic approach

To civilize such code, we can use classic R approach, S4 methods. We'll start from S4 classes declaration.

```{r s4.classes}
.S4_beer          <- setClass("S4_beer", representation(type = "character"))
.S4_opened_beer   <- setClass("S4_opened_beer", representation(type = "character"))
.S4_opener        <- setClass("S4_opener", representation(ID = "numeric"))
.S4_case_of_beers <- setClass("S4_case_of_beers", representation(n_beers = "numeric"))
```

Then, we can two otptions, how to handle `+` operators. I didn't mention about it in the previous example, but both S3 and S4 operators are grouped as so-called **group generic functions** (learn more: [**S3**](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/groupGeneric.html), [**S4**](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/methods/html/S4groupGeneric.html)).

We can set a S4 method for a single operator and that looks as follows:

```{r s4.methods, eval=FALSE}
setMethod("+", c(e1 = "S4_beer", e2 = "S4_opener"),
          function(e1, e2){
  if (inherits(e2, "S4_opener")) {
        return(.S4_opened_beer(type  = paste("opened", e1@type)))
  } else if (inherits(e2, "numeric")) {
    print("It's magic! You've got a case of beers!")
    return(.S4_case_of_beers(n_beers = 1 + e2))
  } else {
    return(e1)
  }
})

setMethod("+", c(e1 = "S4_opener", e2 = "S4_beer"),
          function(e1, e2) e2 + e1)
```


Alternatively, we can define a method for `Arith` geneneric and check, what method is exactly called at the moment.
I decided to use the second approach, because it's more similar to the way the double dispatch is implemented in the **vctrs** library.
```{r s4.methods.arith}
.S4_fun <- function(e1, e2){
  if (inherits(e2, "S4_opener")) {
        return(.S4_opened_beer(type  = paste("opened", e1@type)))
  } else if (inherits(e2, "numeric")) {
    print("It's magic! You've got a case of beers!")
    return(.S4_case_of_beers(n_beers = 1 + e2))
  } else {
    return(e1)
  }
}

setMethod("Arith", c(e1 = "S4_beer", e2 = "S4_opener"),
          function(e1, e2)
          {
            op = .Generic[[1]]
            switch(op,
                   `+`  = .S4_fun(e1, e2),
                    stop("undefined operation")
            )
})

setMethod("Arith", c(e1="S4_opener", e2="S4_beer"),
          function(e1, e2)
          { 
            op = .Generic[[1]]
            switch(op,
                   `+`  = e2 + e1,
                    stop("undefined operation")
            )
})
```

Let's create our class instances and do a piece of math.
```{r s4.objects.instances}
S4_pilsner <- .S4_beer(type = "Pilsner")
S4_opener <- .S4_opener(ID = 1)
```

```{r s4.arith}
S4_pilsner + S4_opener
```

```{r s4.arith.reversed}
S4_opener + S4_pilsner
```

Declared methods are clear, and, the most important: they work correctly.

## vctrs library: a tidyverse approach

[**vctrs**](https://github.com/r-lib/vctrs) is an interesting library, thought as a remedy for a couple of R disadvantages. It delivers, among others, a custom double-dispatch system based on well-known S3 mechanism.

At the first step we declare class 'constructors'.

```{r vctrs}
library(vctrs)

.vec_beer <- function(type){
  new_vctr(.data = list(type  = type), class = "vec_beer")
}

.vec_opened_beer <- function(type){
  new_vctr(.data = list(type  = type), class = "vec_opened_beer")
}

.vec_case_of_beers <- function(n_beers){
  new_vctr(.data = list(n_beers  = n_beers), class = "vec_case_of_beers")
}

.vec_opener <- function(){
  new_vctr(.data = list(), class = "vec_opener")
}
```

Then, we create class instances.
```{r vctrs.class.instances}
vec_pilsner   <- .vec_beer("pilnser")
vec_opener <- .vec_opener()
print(class(vec_pilsner))
print(class(vec_opener))
```

At the end, we write a double-dispatched methods **in vctrs style**. As you can see, 
```{r vctrs.methods}

.fun <- function(a, b){
  if (inherits(b, "vec_opener")) {
        return(.vec_opened_beer(type  = paste("opened", a$type)))
  } else if (inherits(b, "numeric")) {
    print("It's magic! You've got a case of beers!")
    return(.vec_case_of_beers(n_beers = 1 + b))
  } else {
    return(a)
  }
}

vec_arith.vec_beer <- function(op, x, y, ...) {
  UseMethod("vec_arith.vec_beer", y)
}

vec_arith.vec_opener <- function(op, x, y, ...) {
  UseMethod("vec_arith.vec_opener", y)
}

vec_arith.vec_beer.vec_opener <- function(op, x, y, ...){
  switch(op,
         `+` = .fun(x, y),
         stop_incompatible_op(op, x, y)
  )
}

vec_arith.vec_opener.vec_beer <- function(op, x, y, ...){
  y + x
} 

vec_pilsner + vec_opener
vec_opener + vec_pilsner
```

It works properly, too.

## Benchmark

I've created all the classes and methods above not only to demonstate, how to implement double dispatch in R.
My main goal is to benchmark both approaches and check, which one has smaller overhead. The hardware I used for the test looks as follows:

```{r cpu.and.ram, echo=FALSE}
print(benchmarkme::get_cpu())
print(benchmarkme::get_ram())
```

```{r sys}
sessionInfo()
```

It's my good old notebook, which is not a beast.

```{r load.libs}
library(microbenchmark)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Beer + opener
```{r benchmark} 
bm1 <- microbenchmark(
  s4 = S4_pilsner + S4_opener,
  s3_vec = vec_pilsner + vec_opener,
  times = 1000
)
```

```{r print.results.1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print(bm1)
autoplot(bm1) + ggtitle("Fig. 1: S4 vs vctrs addition")
```

### Opener + beer
```{r benchmark.2}
bm2 <- microbenchmark(
  s4 = S4_opener + S4_pilsner,
  s3_vec = vec_opener + vec_pilsner,
  times = 1000
)
```

```{r print.results.2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print(bm2)
autoplot(bm2) + ggtitle("Fig. 2: S4 vs vctrs addition")
```


### Bonus: opener + beer vs addtion of numerics
```{r benchmark.3}
bm3 <- microbenchmark(
  simple_R = 1 + 2,
  s4 = S4_opener + S4_pilsner,
  s3_vec = vec_opener + vec_pilsner,
  times = 1000
)
```


```{r print.results.3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print(bm3)
autoplot(bm3) + ggtitle("Fig. 3: S4 vs vctrs addition")
```

## Conclusions

It seems that **vctrs-based** performs better than traditional **S4 methods**. Obviously, I checked only one operation and probably some edge cases may exists. However, I think that it shows us some direction, what execution time we can expect.

## Further sources

If you are interesting, how to implement double-dispatched operators in S4, I encourage you to get familiar with code of the following R libraries:
