## Installation

### Linux

1. Install Intel MKL Library. The best instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/mkl4deb).
2. Build ArrayFire from source.
3. Install RcppArrayFire
4. Set environmental variables export LD_PRELOAD="/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_core.so:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtbb.so.2:/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_tbb_thread.so:/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_mc3.so:/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_def.so"


You can install the released version of fuego from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("fuego")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("krzjoa/learning-R")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(fuego)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
